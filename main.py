here error is coming as fastAPI read routes like a ladder i.e
 1. It checks for exact matches first
 2. If no exact match is found, it checks for path parameters
 3. Finally, it checks for query parameters

thus the error is occurring because FastAPI is trying to match the request path "/blog/unpublished" with the defined routes "/blog/{id}" and is getting confused because "unpublished" is not a valid integer.
